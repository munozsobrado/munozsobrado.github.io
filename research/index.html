Universalization and the Origins of Fiscal Capacity
[arXiv] — Revise &amp; Resubmit at Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization
 Abstract (click to expand)

This paper proposes a model of tax compliance and fiscal capacity grounded in universalization reasoning. Citizens partially internalize the consequences of concealment by imagining a world in which everyone acted similarly, linking their compliance decisions to the perceived effectiveness of public spending. A selfish elite chooses between public goods and private rents, taking compliance as given. In equilibrium, citizens&#39; moral internalization expands the feasible tax base and induces elites to allocate resources toward provision rather than appropriation. When the value of public spending is uncertain, morality enables credible reform: high-value elites can signal their type through provision, prompting citizens to increase compliance and raising fiscal capacity within the same period. The analysis thus identifies a moral channel through which states may escape low-capacity traps even under weak institutions.

Taxing Moral Agents\n[CESifo Working Paper]\nAbstract (click to expand) Experimental and empirical findings suggest that non-pecuniary motivations play a significant role as determinants of taxpayers’ decisions to comply with the tax authority and shape their perceptions and assessment of the tax code. By contrast, the canonical optimal income taxation model focuses on material sanctions as the primary motive for compliance. This paper shows how taxpayers equipped with evolutionary Kantian preferences can account for both these non-pecuniary and material motivations. It builds a general model of income taxation in the presence of a public good, which agents value morally, and solves for the optimal linear and non-linear taxation problems.

I argue that the current approaches to determining the optimal level of such tax benefits neglect a crucial ingredient. While higher tax benefits increase charitable giving, they also intensify potentially wasteful competition for funds among charities. I build a model where charities use informative advertising to attract individual donors. Competition leads to inefficient fundraising as charities incur excessive advertising costs, and the inefficiency increases as available funds increase. I then estimate the structural parameters of the model using data from the universe of Nonprofits in the U.S. paired with data from the country's most prominent charity assessment organization. I document that leakage, the proportion of charities' budget not spent on direct public good provision, goes up to 40 percent in my sample for 2014. Moreover, findings from counterfactual analyses suggest that fundraising accounts for significant endogenous leakage of gross donations into advertising. These findings suggest that estimates that ignore competition must be adjusted downwards to account for charities' endogenous responses to the tax code.
