Competing for Donations: The Role of Tax Deductibility in the U.S. Charitable Sector  [new version coming soon]
 Abstract (click to expand)

 Around the world, governments provide tax benefits to incentivize charitable giving. I argue that the current approaches to determining the optimal level of such tax benefits  neglect a crucial ingredient. While higher tax benefits increase charitable giving, they also intensify potentially wasteful competition for funds among charities. I build a model where charities use informative advertising to attract individual donors. Competition leads to inefficient fundraising as charities incur excessive advertising costs, and the inefficiency increases as available funds increase. I then estimate the structural parameters of the model using data from the universe of Nonprofits in the U.S. paired with data from the country&#39;s most prominent charity assessment organization. I document that leakage, the proportion of charities&#39; budget not spent on direct public good provision,  goes up to 40 percent in my sample for 2014. Moreover, findings from counterfactual analyses suggest that fundraising accounts for significant endogenous leakage of gross donations into advertising. These findings suggest that estimates that ignore competition must be adjusted downwards to account for charities&#39; endogenous responses to the tax code.

An agent exerts effort and privately chooses resource allocation between two types of capital: one that increases the productivity of exerting effort and one that reduces its cost. Our analysis provides conditions such that the agent's problem exhibits complementarity between effort and productivity.

The paper's main result provides sufficient conditions on the production problem such that the agent strictly benefits from the allocation being private information.
